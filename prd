Product Name (working)

Price Memory
Name is temporary. Do not waste time renaming it.

Problem Statement

Small traders buy goods frequently and rely on memory or paper invoices to remember past prices. Paper invoices are often lost or damaged, and memory fails over time. When prices change or confirmation is needed, the trader cannot reliably recall what was paid before, leading to poor pricing decisions and stress.

Target User

Small-scale market traders

Initial user: one trader (your mom)

Uses a smartphone daily

Not technical

Values speed and simplicity over features

Core User Pain

Forgetting the price of items previously purchased

Losing or misplacing paper invoices

No simple way to check past purchase prices

This product exists to reduce memory load. Nothing else.

Product Goal

Enable traders to quickly record and later retrieve what they bought, when they bought it, and how much they paid.

Success Metrics

The product is successful if:

A purchase can be recorded in under 10 seconds

A past price can be found without searching paper invoices

The user willingly uses the app again after the first day

No downloads, no growth metrics, no fantasies.

Speed matters more than visual design

Risks

Future Ideas (Parked, Not Built)

These do not exist yet. Pretend they don’t.

Final Rule

If a feature does not help the user remember past purchase prices, it does not belong in version 1.
